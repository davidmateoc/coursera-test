        Coursera is coool!!
    </h1>
    <div>First Div will go alone</div>
    <div>Second div will also go alone on a new line</div>
    <span>This is an inline element, but the previous div pushes this span to a new line</span>
    <div>This third div contains an inline element <span>And therefore since this span is an inline element it is added without adding a new line</span></div>
